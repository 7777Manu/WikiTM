                    One of the most visited and instagrammable tourist attractions in Timișoara is represented by "Piața Victoriei". This is also known as Piața Operei and represents the central square of the city of Timișoara. Moreover, in this place, but on December 20, 1989, Timișoara was declared the first city free from communism in Romania. If you look carefully at the Opera House, you can still see the traces of bullets fired during the events of that period.

                    In the past, it was thought to house restaurants and luxury shops. Later, with the appearance of the Metropolitan Cathedral and housing blocks, the square was closed. After the tram lines were removed, the square became a pedestrian-only area, perfect for walkers and tourists.

                    Victoriei Square is home to the Romanian National Opera and the Metropolitan Cathedral, two of the city's most representative monuments. Also, in this area are the Artesian Fountain "to fish", the Wolf with cubs, but also the Museum of Banat hosted by the Huniade Castle.
