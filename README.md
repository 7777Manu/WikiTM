Let's talk about our little project,WikiTM.

We are 4 boys.
Andrei and Emanuel worked on website creation and website development and Raul and Razvan worked on customizing the site.

First time when I came to Timisoara I was so confused cause I didn't know what to do and especially what to visit so 2 days ago this idea came in my mind and we started the project WikiTM.

WikiTM is the website where can you search for atractions in Timisoara based on your location and where you can read a little description about the atraction.
At the moment we have only 4 atractions because we focused on the website dev.

WikiTM has appeared as a solution for new visitors of Timisoara so I hope it will a solution for more and more people who will visit Timisoara.

We used C++/Java,HTML,CSS and other programmes for editing and creating logo.
