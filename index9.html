                    "Piața Libertății" carries with it the memories of history. In the past, this was also called Parade Square or Prince Eugen Square due to the events that took place here.

                    Nowadays there are many locals who call it the "old town hall square". Why? It houses one of the most important and impressive buildings built between 1731 and 1734. The building was built in the Baroque style and popularly called the Old Town Hall. It is positioned on the side with the tram lines and can be noticed very easily.

                    To the right of the entrance to the building is an inscription, which is evidence of the period when the city was occupied by the Ottomans. If you look up, on the upper part of the facade you can even see the old coat of arms of the city.

                    But the most visible monument in the square is the Statue of Saint Nepomuk. It is located in the middle of Liberty Square and is similar to that of the Holy Trinity, in Union Square. The two markets are located very close to each other, less than 5 minutes' walk away.
